# heart-attack-data
Data and code for yet another adventure in machine learning for Ars Technica. 

The data here is from the <a href="https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease">UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a>, originally derived from the work of medical research at the Cleveland Clinic and the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. (See the UC Irvine page for cites.) I went back to this source after looking at data on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset?resource=download">Kaggle</a> derived from the original set without citation; it's in public domain.

Python code and much weeping will follow.
